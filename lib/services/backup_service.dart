/// Backup and restore.
///
/// Why this shape
/// --------------
/// Hive lives in the app's private directory, which Android deletes on
/// uninstall, so durable copies have to leave the sandbox. The previous design
/// did that by writing to `/storage/emulated/0/Documents/RecallDay` through
/// raw `dart:io` paths. That is not a reliable contract on modern Android, and
/// it failed three separate ways in practice:
///
///   • A write could appear to succeed while the matching read failed with
///     `PathAccessException … errno = 13`: without a real
///     MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE grant, some operations pass through a media
///     shim and others are refused outright.
///   • `File.exists()` returns *false* rather than throwing when access is
///     denied, so a present-but-forbidden backup looked like no backup at all
///     and the first-launch prompt reported "none found".
///   • The write-to-temp-then-rename dance left `.writing` files behind, and
///     the OS silently rewrote their extension (`.writing.json` arrived as
///     `.writing.js`) — plain evidence that the platform, not the filesystem,
///     was deciding what happened.
///
/// So raw shared-storage paths are gone, along with the storage permissions
/// they needed. Instead:
///
///   1. **Automatic** — after every change a JSON snapshot is written to
///      app-private storage. This always succeeds, needs no permission, and is
///      covered by Android Auto Backup, so a Play or `adb` reinstall restores
///      it invisibly. It's also what the first-launch prompt reads.
///   2. **Export** — one `.zip` holding the database *and every attachment*,
///      handed to the system share sheet. The user saves it to Drive, Files,
///      or sends it to themselves. The OS owns the destination, so there is no
///      permission to be denied.
///   3. **Import** — chosen through the system file picker, which grants read
///      access to that one file. This is why importing works where reading a
///      raw path did not.
///
/// Attachments were previously absent from backups entirely, so a restore
/// produced topics pointing at files that no longer existed. The export
/// carries them and the import rewrites every path for the new install.
