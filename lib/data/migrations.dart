/// Give every subtopic a parent topic.
///
/// The tree used to be Subject → Topic, and what was called a topic is
/// what the app now calls a subtopic: the scheduled leaf. Rather than move
/// those records — which would have meant rewriting every id that reviews,
/// attachment folders and notification blocks are keyed by — the upgrade
/// leaves them exactly where they are and builds the missing layer above them.
///
/// Each unparented subtopic gets a topic of its own, named after it, so a user
/// upgrading sees the library they already had with one more level of nesting,
/// not a pile of unrelated leaves swept into a "General" bucket.
///
/// Two properties matter more than the shape of the result:
///
///   • **Idempotent.** It only ever touches a subtopic whose [topicId] is
///     missing, so running it on every launch costs one pass over the box and
///     changes nothing once the tree is whole.
///   • **Self-healing.** A [topicId] pointing at a topic that isn't there —
///     which a partial restore, or a backup written by a build in between, can
///     produce — is treated the same as a missing one. That keeps a subtopic
///     from becoming unreachable in the UI, which is the one failure mode here
///     that looks like data loss without being it.
///
/// Returns the number of topics created.
