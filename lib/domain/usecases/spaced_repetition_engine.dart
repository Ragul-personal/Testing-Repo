/// Policy: walk a fixed Leitner-style ladder, then hold.
///   • Default ladder: [1, 3, 7, 14, 30] days — the first month is a ramp.
///   • The top rung is a *plateau*, not a stop. Once a subtopic reaches it, every
///     later revision falls one more month out; intervals never grow past it.
///   • "Forgot" rewinds to ladder index 0 with a damped ease reduction; ease
///     never drops below [easeFloor].
///
/// The plateau falls out of the clamp in [schedule] rather than needing a
/// branch of its own: `math.min(index + advance, ladder.length - 1)` parks on
/// the last rung and keeps returning it.
///
/// This replaced an SM-2 steady state (`interval × ease × ratingMultiplier`,
/// capped at 730 days). Because the UI records a single neutral "Done", every
/// real review arrived as `good` with ease pinned at its 2.5 default, so that
/// phase only ever produced 7 → 18 → 45 → 113 → 282 days — revisions drifting
/// years apart, which is not what a reminder app is for. Ease is still tracked
/// and recorded on every review, so difficulty-aware scheduling can come back
/// without reconstructing the state it needs.
