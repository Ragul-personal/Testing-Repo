/// The leaf of the library: Subject → Topic → **Subtopic**.
///
/// A subtopic is the only thing the app actually schedules. Subjects and
/// topics are grouping layers with no spaced-repetition state of their own,
/// which is why every reminder, review record and attachment hangs off an id
/// from here.
///
/// SR state lives on the subtopic. The scheduler walks a fixed interval ladder
/// (default Leitner: 1d, 3d, 7d, 14d, 30d) and then holds on the last rung, so
/// revisions settle at one a month rather than growing without bound.
///   • [ladderIndex] is the current rung; it never exceeds the ladder's length.
///   • A "forgot" rating at any stage resets repetitions to 0 and rewinds to
///     the first ladder rung, but preserves an attenuated ease factor.
///   • [ease] and [currentIntervalDays] are still recorded on every review;
///     ease no longer feeds the interval.
///
/// [subjectId] is denormalised alongside [topicId] on purpose: the Today
/// screen, the calendar and the notification body all want the subject's name
/// and colour, and carrying it here means none of them has to walk up through
/// the topic box to find it. `TopicCommands` keeps the two in step — moving a
/// topic to another subject rewrites its subtopics' [subjectId] too.
